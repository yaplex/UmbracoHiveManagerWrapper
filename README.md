Umbraco 5 Hive Manager wrapper
======================

The project contains source codes from the blog post
[Umbraco 5: Get content from HiveManager using separate application](http://blog.yaplex.com/umbraco/umbraco-5-get-content-from-hivemanager-using-separate-application/ "Access HiveManager outside of Umbraco")

And this is also my first experience with GitHub :)
